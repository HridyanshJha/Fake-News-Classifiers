Fake News Classifier

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Fake News Classifier that detects misleading or false news articles using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Currently, the repository includes data visualization and prediction results, with frontend development planned for future updates.

ðŸš€ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key patterns in the dataset.
Machine Learning Model: Trained using NLP techniques to classify news as fake or real.
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Upcoming: Interactive web application for real-time predictions.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, NaÃ¯ve Bayes
